# AWS Static Website Project

I created a static website of my resume using Amazon S3, and then distributed it globally via CloudFront. This project is part of my cloud portfolio as I begin my cloud journey.

# Services Used

- Amazon S3 (static site hosting)
- AWS CloudFront (CDN distribution)

# How I Deployed

1. Upload static files (HTML/CSS/JS) to an S3 bucket.
2. Enable static website hosting on the bucket.
3. Set up CloudFront distribution pointing to the S3 origin.
